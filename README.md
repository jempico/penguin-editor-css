While learning the basics of CSS via FreeCodeCamp I came across this little cute penguin, which I decided to recreate from scratch, using pure CSS. 

After learning more about JavaScript and the DOM I refactored it so that users could change how it looks like. 

Things I learned while doing it:

1- CSS Fundamentals
2- How to update CSS variables with JavaScript
3- How to add CSS animations
